## Introduction
For christmas, I received my first weather station but I can't connect it to Internet on the cloud to get weather data.
Because of that, I decide to reverse engineering my weather station by using a 433Mhz receiver, an arduino or a RaspberryPi.
My thinking process start by searching on the Internet, if somebody did this, I found lot of solutions.

## Technology

## Part 1 : Reverse Engineering the 433Mhz signal

## Part 2 : Analyze the 433Mhz signal

## Part 3 : Reveiving packets with the Arduino/RaspberryPi

## Conclusion

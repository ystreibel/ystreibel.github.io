## Introduction
This is the first article of my personal website. I would like to share my knowledge and experiments in IT.

## Technology
This is a static website that use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Dbyll](http://jekyllbootstrap3.tk/dbyll/).

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (or [Textile](http://redcloth.org/textile)) and [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) converters, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/), which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.

Dbyl is a two column stylish theme for jekyll-boostrap-3. Port of original [dbyll theme for Jekyll](http://github.com/dbtek/dbyll).

## Deployement and Hosting

I use a Free hosting with GitHub Pages [github](http://pages.github.com/)

Sick of dealing with hosting companies? GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll, so you can easily deploy your site using GitHub for free—custom domain name and all.
Learn more about GitHub Pages.

## Conclusion
This is an awesome mean to make easy and quickly static websites, all for free.

## Introduction
This is the first article of my personal website. I would like to share my knowledge, experiments in IT and other stuff. 
I'm not a good english speaker or writer, but I decide to wrote my posts in english to touch larger community.
## Technology
This is a static website that use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Dbyll](http://jekyllbootstrap3.tk/dbyll/).

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (or [Textile](http://redcloth.org/textile)) and [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) converters, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/), which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.

Dbyl is a two column stylish theme for jekyll-boostrap-3. Port of original [dbyll theme for Jekyll](http://github.com/dbtek/dbyll).

## Deployement and Hosting

I use a Free hosting with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) but for some github reason about Jekyll custom plugins, I'm using [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.com/) build to generate the site in [master](https://github.com/ystreibel/ystreibel.github.io/tree/master) branch from [source](https://github.com/ystreibel/ystreibel.github.io/tree/source) branch.

Sick of dealing with hosting companies? GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll, so you can easily deploy your site using GitHub for free—custom domain name and all.

## Conclusion
This is an awesome mean to make easy and quickly static websites, all for free.

        Hi everyone, I'm Yohann.<br />
        I'm fascinated to high tech most specifically to software development.<br /> 
        <br />
        I like to allow people access to services through Internet. That's why I'm working on web servers API.<br />
        <br />
        It's the same things for presenting the data provides by server API to final users.<br /> 
        I also used to work on fronted application with native and web software development languages.<br />
        I'm a fan of Polymer, web component and progressive app.<br />
        <br />
        I'm used to develop proof of concept, it's allowed me to test new technology and say to people "It's possible to do this!"<br />
